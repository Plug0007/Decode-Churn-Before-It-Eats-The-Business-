🧪 Mission: Predict Customer Churn

🕵️‍♀️ Story:
Your boss Meena Ma’am is panicking. “If we lose more customers, we’ll be dancing in bankruptcy court!”
You’re the new Data Scientist intern at Datawaale Inc., and she’s just dropped a CSV file on your desk.

📂 Your Tasks:
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset (missing values, encoding, scaling)
2. Perform EDA with graphs (correlations, churn rates by segment)
3. Build a predictive model (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree)
4. Show performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
5. Share a PDF report of your findings with clear visualizations & business insights.

🎯 Bonus: Show churn probability for a random test case and visualize feature importance.
